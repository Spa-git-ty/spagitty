# Roadmap

The order the outstanding work is meant to be taken in, and why each piece sits
where it does. This is a reading of the index in [README.md](README.md) against
the gap analysis in [../docs/analysis/gitkraken-gap.md](../docs/analysis/gitkraken-gap.md);
the index stays the authority on what exists and what state it is in.

Every entry below now has an identifier. The four that came out of the gap
analysis rather than out of a request were named as they were started —
FEAT-048, FEAT-049, FEAT-050 and FEAT-051 — because the record test refuses a
cited identifier that resolves to nothing, so naming them earlier would have
broken the suite for no gain.

Sizes are the author's working estimate for someone who already knows the tree,
and they assume the existing test conventions are followed.

**Every entry under Now and Next is done**, and the Later section is being
worked through in the order it is written. They were worked one commit each,
between 2026-08-24 and 2026-08-25.

## Now

### 1. FEAT-047 — the branches table: resizable columns, and a divergence worth reading

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-047-branch-table`. Finishing it clears the only open branch and
leaves the Branches screen ready for the delete and rename work that follows.

**Closed by:** a per-repository column store with its own storage prefix, and a
two-sided divergence bar scaled against the widest drift on screen.

### 2. FEAT-048 — discard changes

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-048-discard-changes`.

The largest hole in daily use, and the cheapest to fill. Working copy can
stage, unstage and commit; nothing there can throw a change away, so the most
common mistake in a working day sends the user to the terminal. The gap
analysis names it as the one deliberate omission that should not have been one.

**Closed by:** discard file, discard hunk and discard all on the unstaged side,
each behind a confirmation whose wording says whether the file is reverted or
deleted. The staged side is deliberately untouched.

### 3. FEAT-013 — branch delete and rename

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-013-branch-delete-rename`.

**Closed by:** row-level delete and rename, a bulk merged cleanup that shows
every name before it runs, and a confirmation that carries the actual command
to bring an unmerged branch back rather than pointing vaguely at the reflog.

### 4. FEAT-015 — rebase execution

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-015-rebase-execution`.

**Closed by:** a worker that runs the rebase without holding the session lock,
progress read from git's own state counters rather than parsed from its output,
and a stopped state that hands off to Conflicts with continue, skip and abort
beside it.

### 5. FEAT-016 — conflict resolution writes

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-016-conflict-writes`.

**Closed by:** three ways out of a file — a whole side, one marker region, or
text typed into the merged pane — each followed by an explicit `git add`, plus
Continue and an Abort that says what comes back for the operation it is aborting.
The conflicted stash apply recovery flow is still parked; it was not in scope.

## Next

### 6. FEAT-049 — remotes management

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-049-remotes`.

**Closed by:** a Settings → Remotes section that adds, renames, removes and
retargets, each through `git remote` rather than a config edit. The `-u`
question was answered: push had no `--set-upstream`, so every new branch was
left unmapped and FEAT-047's divergence bar had nothing to read. Fixed.

### 7. FEAT-050 — reflog view

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-050-reflog`.

**Closed by:** a Reflog screen at rail entry 1L, reading HEAD or any local
branch, with three ways out of an entry — branch here, check out here, reset
here — offered in that order because only the first cannot cost anything.

### 8. FEAT-051 — tags list

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-051-tags`.

**Closed by:** a Tags screen at rail entry 1N with create, delete, message
rewriting and checkout, and annotated told apart from lightweight throughout —
the difference decides whether a message can exist at all.

### 8b. FEAT-056 — the detail panel can be put away

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-019-commit-signing`.

**Closed by:** a hidden set beside the panel widths, and a toggle on the two
screens with a right-hand panel. A hidden panel keeps the width it was dragged
to, so bringing it back is a toggle rather than a resize.

### 8c. FEAT-055 — the window paints on the path that works

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-019-commit-signing`.

**Closed by:** the Linux rendering path measured on a real window — twice per
run, because the accelerated one paints first and loses its buffer afterwards —
and written as a pure policy function with a test per row. The software path
stays the default because it is the one that keeps painting; the interface, now
knowing it rasterizes on the CPU, stopped asking for fifty-four blurred layers.

### 9. FEAT-018 — finish fetch and push

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-018-finish-fetch-push`.

**Closed by:** pruning as a setting rather than something that always happened,
progress streamed from a worker, per-remote fetch behind a right-click, and a
Branches header that says how old its drift numbers are. The upstream on first
push had already been fixed in FEAT-049.

### 10. FEAT-033 — branch divergence on the chip

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-033-divergence-on-the-chip`.

**Closed by:** `branches::divergences`, one read that both the Branches rows and
the graph's chips look up — the item made not having two of them a criterion —
and `↓3 ↑2` on the chip in the same order and colours as the bar. A level branch
draws nothing and still answers in its tooltip.

## Later

### 11. FEAT-017 — forge integration

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-019-commit-signing`, continuing the stack.

**Closed by:** `spagitty-core::forge` — `ureq` with native TLS reached from one
file, one GraphQL request per refresh rather than 1 + 3N REST calls, a personal
access token in the OS keychain with the login read back from the host, and four
failures told apart rather than one.

Both things the roadmap said to decide first were decided. The HTTP client is
owned by the Rust core, so the webview keeps its promise of having no way to
make a request and never holds a token. The test that forbade an HTTP client
became a narrower one worth keeping: exactly one client, only in the core, only
reachable from `forge/http.rs`.

Read-only, and GitHub only. Issues, CI status on the graph, clone-from-host and
GitLab were all outside the item and remain unwritten.

### 12. FEAT-019 — commit signing

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-019-commit-signing`.

**Closed by:** `spagitty-core::signing`, and an answer to the item's open
question — `commit.gpgsign` is the authority, so the toggle left Spagitty's
preferences file instead of being wired up, and Settings gained a Signing
section beside the identity. `--gpg-sign` on the commit, a signing failure
reported as one rather than as "commit failed", the two conditions that can be
known before the commit is attempted, and `signed` on every graph row.

Finished by the notice on the Working copy screen — said before the button, not
after a failure — and `S` on the graph row with the full sentence in the detail
panel. Nothing anywhere says *verified*, and a test holds that.

### 13. FEAT-034 — browse a stash entry file by file

**Done**, on `feature/FEAT-034-stash-file-browsing`.

**Closed by:** the Diff screen's own `FileList` and `DiffPane`, made to take
what they render so both screens use one renderer, and a Stash screen of four
columns — entries, files, diff, detail. No new backend read: a stash is a
commit, and `file_diff` on its id was already there.

### 14. TASK-003 — make the Tauri layer generic over `Runtime`

**Done**, on `task/TASK-003-runtime-generic`. The only entry that buys nothing a
user can see; what it buys is tests against the command layer without a window.

**Closed by:** `AppHandle<R>` throughout `src-tauri`, `spagitty-core`'s fixtures
published behind a `fixture` feature so the Tauri layer walks a real repository,
and seventeen tests over the graph worker's windowing, the watcher's debounce
and the session. It found no bugs.

### 15. The candidate feature backlog

Formally specified and indexed as Backlog items under TASK-029:

- **FEAT-062 — Worktrees management:** List, add, switch, and prune git worktrees via `git worktree` with workspace tabs integration.
- **FEAT-063 — File history and blame view:** Dedicated file evolution timeline with line-by-line interactive blame gutter.
- **FEAT-064 — Diff syntax highlighting:** Grammar-based syntax highlighting in diff view and merge editor across all themes.
- **FEAT-065 — Image and binary diffs:** 2-up, swipe slider, and onion skin visual diffs for images plus binary delta metadata.
- **FEAT-066 — Diff content search:** Regex and literal search inside commit patches using `git log -G` / `git log -S`.
- **FEAT-067 — Submodules management:** Submodule tree status list, recursive init/update, and branch alignment indicators.
- **FEAT-068 — External diff and merge tool launchers:** Tool discovery and launch triggers for external CLI/GUI diff/merge apps.
- **FEAT-069 — Multi-identity profiles:** Identity profile switching for author names, emails, and signing keys per repository scope.
- **FEAT-070 — Extended forge integration:** GitLab and Bitbucket API support, in-app PR creation, and issue tracking links.
## Deliberately not on this list

Recorded so they do not resurface as gaps: dragging commits onto branches,
inline commit-message editing on the graph, manual lane layout and independent
graph zoom, all in `docs/reference/gitkraken-commit-graph.md`; and
workspace/cloud sync, which is out of character for an offline-first client.
