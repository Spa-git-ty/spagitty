//! What an agent is told.
//!
//! # The rule this module exists to enforce
//!
//! *Do not dump the entire repository into every prompt.* It is expensive, it
//! is slow, and it is counter-productive: an agent given a hundred files reads
//! a hundred files, and the one it needed is diluted. The agents Spagitty
//! drives are all capable of reading the repository themselves — they are
//! standing in a checkout of it — so the prompt's job is not to *contain* the
//! context but to say precisely what the task is and where its edges are.
//!
//! So a prompt is short and structured: the goal, the task, what "done" means,
//! which files may be touched, the repository's own rules, what the tasks this
//! one depends on concluded, how it will be verified, and the shape of the
//! answer. Nothing else.
//!
//! # Why every section is always present
//!
//! Even when empty, with an explicit "none". A section that disappears when it
//! has no content teaches the agent nothing; a section that says "Allowed
//! files: the whole repository" tells it something true and important.
