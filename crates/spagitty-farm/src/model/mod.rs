//! The farm's vocabulary: what a goal, a task, an agent and a run *are*.
//!
//! Everything here is data. No process is spawned, no file is written and no
//! git command runs from this module tree — that is deliberate, because these
//! types are what the scheduler, the persistence layer, the Tauri commands and
//! the webview all agree on, and a type that can do something is a type that
//! two of those four will use to do it in the wrong layer.
//!
//! # Why the identifiers are newtypes and not `String`
//!
//! A farm juggles four families of identifier at once — tasks, agents, runs and
//! farms — and they are all strings underneath. Passing a run id where a task id
//! belongs is the kind of mistake that produces a farm which looks fine and
//! schedules nothing. Newtypes make it a compile error instead. They serialise
//! as plain strings, so the webview never sees the wrapper.
