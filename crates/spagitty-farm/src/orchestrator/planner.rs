//! Turning a sentence into a plan.
//!
//! The user types "Add GitHub OAuth login" and gets a list of tasks. The plan
//! puts this at phase 7, after everything else works, and the ordering is the
//! point: a planner is only useful once there is a farm that can execute what
//! it plans, and a farm that plans badly but executes well is fixable by hand.
//!
//! # The agent proposes; Spagitty owns the graph
//!
//! A planning agent returns a *proposal* — titles, kinds, dependencies — and
//! nothing in it is trusted. [`adopt`] is what turns a proposal into tasks, and
//! it does four things the agent cannot be relied on to do:
//!
//! 1. Assigns real identifiers. The agent's `depends_on` refers to its own
//!    numbering, which is remapped rather than believed.
//! 2. Drops references to tasks that do not exist.
//! 3. Refuses a plan with a cycle in it, rather than importing one.
//! 4. Caps the length, because a model asked to decompose a goal will sometimes
//!    return sixty tasks and none of them are real.
//!
//! The user still approves the result before anything runs. That is a farm
//! setting, not a property of this module.
