//! A working tree of its own for every task.
//!
//! The plan calls this non-negotiable and it is right to. Two agents in one
//! checkout is not a race that shows up occasionally — it is one agent reading
//! a half-written file from another while a third runs the tests over the
//! result, every time. A worktree per task makes each one's edits invisible to
//! the others until the branch is merged, which is the point at which Spagitty
//! is a Git client and can show the user what happened.
//!
//! # Where they go, and why not inside the repository
//!
//! ```text
//! <repo>/.spagitty/farm/worktrees/task-0042/
//! ```
//!
//! Inside the repository, so a user who looks for them finds them next to the
//! code they belong to, and so deleting the repository deletes them. `.spagitty`
//! is added to `.git/info/exclude` when the first one is cut, rather than to
//! `.gitignore`: the ignore file is the user's, it is committed, and a tool that
//! edits it has changed the repository's content without being asked.
//!
//! # Nothing here reimplements git
//!
//! Every operation goes through [`spagitty_core::shell`], which is the module
//! that owns every mutating git command in the product and records what it ran.
//! A worktree created by this crate therefore shows up in the same command log
//! as one the user created from the Worktrees screen.
