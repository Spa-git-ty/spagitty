//! History operations the graph offers: reset, revert, cherry-pick, merge,
//! rebase, tags, and detaching HEAD.
//!
//! Every function here is a thin, *named* wrapper over [`crate::shell`]. The
//! naming is the point: `git reset --hard` is one command with three very
//! different meanings depending on a flag, and the graph's menu spells out
//! which one it is about to do. Turning that choice into a Rust enum means the
//! webview can never send a string that resolves to a harder reset than the one
//! the user read.
//!
//! # What is checked here, and what is not
//!
//! Nothing here validates a ref name, a revision or whether an operation makes
//! sense — `git` already knows all of it, its refusals name the actual problem,
//! and a second implementation of those rules could only disagree with the
//! first. What *is* checked here is the small set of things git will happily do
//! and the user did not ask for:
//!
//! - Deleting the branch that is checked out. Git refuses this one itself, but
//!   the message is about HEAD rather than about the branch, so it is caught
//!   here where the better sentence can be written.
//! - Reverting a merge without saying which side is the mainline. Git refuses;
//!   the graph always means the first parent, so that is supplied.
//!
//! # Confirmation is the caller's job
//!
//! `reset --hard` discards uncommitted work and `delete_branch(force)` discards
//! commits. Neither asks. The Settings screen's `confirmHistoryRewrite` toggle
//! and the graph's confirmation dialogs are where the question gets asked, and
//! they are deliberately *above* this layer: a core that prompted would be a
//! core that could not be scripted or tested.
