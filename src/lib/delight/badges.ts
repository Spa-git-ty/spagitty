/**
 * The badge catalogue (FEAT-072).
 *
 * Data, and nothing else. What earns a badge lives in `engine.ts`, what a badge
 * looks like lives in `BadgeChip.svelte`, and what noise it makes lives in
 * `sound.ts` — this file only says which badges exist and what they mean, so
 * adding one is a row here plus a rule there rather than an edit in five
 * places.
 *
 * # Two axes, not one
 *
 * `category` says what kind of accomplishment it is; `rarity` says how hard it
 * was. They are separate because a `chaos` badge can be common and a `git`
 * badge can be legendary, and folding them into one field means every new badge
 * has to lie about one of the two.
 *
 * `secret` is a flag rather than a rarity for the same reason: a secret badge
 * still has a difficulty, and the badge screen needs to know both — one decides
 * the treatment it is drawn with, the other decides whether it is drawn at all
 * before it is earned.
 *
 * # The rule the whole file is written against
 *
 * Nothing here rewards usage. There is no badge for opening Spagitty, for
 * committing often, or for having the window in front of you — every row below
 * is earned by doing something skilful, recovering from something bad, or doing
 * something funny enough that a developer would tell somebody about it.
